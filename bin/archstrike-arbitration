"""Arbitrates a list of packages that can be installed without error

Changes in packages upstream continuously change. Sometimes those changes break ArchStrike packages. So, 
archstrike-arbitration judges which packages to install.

Example usage:
    $ resolve_archstrike_group --file <path>/<to>/archstrike-iso/configs/openbox/packages.both
    $ ./bin/archstrike-arbitration --file ./packages.{both,x86_64} --package alot diffoscope reprotest

Through the example usage both the archstrike group and `../configs/openbox/packages.both` are inspected for
 * packages that cannot be found or have a dependency that cannot be found
 * conflicts between two pactree: any package in their dependency tree conflicts with a dependency in the other tree

tl;dr good archstrike packages are written on stdout and bad packages are summarized on stderr
